## Motivation

This is the first addon I created with Odoo. It's aim is to be useful when organising projects for reforestate an area.


## Installation

Move this module to your addons folder. Then restart your Odoo server and, while in developer mode, click the button Update Apps List from the Apps addons.

## Usage

With it you can create a project, and then include all the information you need, like location, dates, investment, teams, list of plantes needed and so on. Then you can move it to further stages, review the progress of the work, make a valuation, and of course, cancel it at any point.

Basically a team is a group of contacts with a responsible.

Warning: This module is a little bit buggy at this point. Problably just would need some love for a while, not really a big deal.
